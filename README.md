SageMath scripts (python-based language) supporting computations for research papers

This repository hosts the scripts I used to support my research while I was working as a research mathematician. 

Unfortunately, I won't be able to debug these scripts for compatibility with newer versions of SageMath, Macaulay2 and Polymake.

Since I wrote the scripts for my own (and my coauthors') purposes only, with no intention of publishing packages out of them, I largely neglected code efficiency and elegance as well as user interaction (for instance, no checks are made for consistency of function arguments).

That said, I hope these script can be of use to anyone ever wanting to reproduce my computations.
